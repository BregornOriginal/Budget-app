# Budget-app

I've been working on this RoR Capstone for the last 3 days, the app is about a Bugdet-app.

There is a splash home page where you have the option to log_in and sign_up in the app. If you don't have an account you can't visit the webpage.

The sig_up option has a email-validation, were I added the gem `letter-opener` to acept the email confirmation.

When a user is Log_in you can visit the app and work in yours categories and transactions.

Also this have a database on Postresql, where the data is stored an avaible to use.

You can create a category and add expenses to it.

You can see the total amount of your expenses of each category, and the total amount of all the expenses in general.

The style followed is a mobile-first structure.
